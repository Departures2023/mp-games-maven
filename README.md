Instructions:

Tile Flip is a puzzle game where your goal is to flip all tiles to "O" (There are originally some "X" blocks in the matrix). You control which tile is selected by entering the block's row and column number to flip the tile, but all the 4-directionally adjacent tiles are also flipped.
